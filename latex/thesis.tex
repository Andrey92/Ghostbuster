\sommario

Recently embedded systems have become more and more integrated with several aspects of our lives, and their security concerns have risen as well.
In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which are embedded systems deployed within the context of an Industrial Control System (ICS),
needs to be reliable and secure because they can have direct effects on critical processes.
From an engineering perspective, they are connected to sensors and actuators and use Input/Output (I/O) interfaces to interact with the physical world.
As demonstrated by a novel kind of attack, called Pin Control Attack or I/O attack, a malicious user can tamper with the integrity or
the availability of legitimate I/O operations, possibly causing physical damage to people and environment.
The purpose of this thesis can be divided into two main steps.
First, we want to analyse this new threat and discuss its applicability on real PLCs.
Second, we design and implement a detection system able to raise the bar for the attacker.
The implementation, provided as a Linux kernel module, is evaluated on an ARM-based architecture,
showing its effectiveness and impact on PLCs, which typically have very limited resources and strict timing requirements.
